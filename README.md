ðŸ§  Next Word Prediction using LSTM

This project is a Streamlit web app that predicts the next word in a sentence using a trained LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network model.

ðŸš€ Features

Predicts the next word based on user input.

Uses a pre-trained LSTM model for sequence prediction.

Simple and interactive Streamlit interface.
